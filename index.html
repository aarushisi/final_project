                    </div>
                    <p>I am a current student studying computer science at the University of Michigan. My coding journey started from developing a simple website from HTML and CSS back in high school. I was absolutely fascinated seeing my idea come to life and since then, I knew programming would be my future. Now, I am taking courses like Data Structures & Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics to solidify my technical knowledge. Alongside courses, I have been part of several projects </p>
                    
                    <p>If I am not studying, you'll find me with my friends or in my room, cuddled up in a blanket ready to watch a show. I love cooking as well as exploring restaurants in downtown Ann Arbor. Learning new recipes and tricks are my favorite part of cooking. I also am learning how to play a guitar. Reach out if you want to talk about anything I mentioned. </p>
